{"author": "FriNFyDay", "body": "Now NFY is also a FPS game.\nWith many new features being added, sometimes it's hard to keep up!\n\nWe would like to thank our community, and contributors for helping manage NFy.\n\nIf you didn't know, NFy is made on the Godot Engine, and has very advanced features. Including the secret easter egg!\n\nThis update fixes the \"Null\" News, and adds light mode!\n\nWith light mode, it contains it's own theme, and doesn't really change the buttons.\n\nA modular system for the news window was implemented, and it'll hopefully be better for more windows. Maybe even\na window API!", "title": "Kai Gonzalez & contrib."}
