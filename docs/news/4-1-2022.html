<p>Now NFY is also a FPS game.
With many new features being added, sometimes it's hard to keep up!

We would like to thank our community, and contributors for helping manage NFy.

If you didn't know, NFy is made on the Godot Engine, and has very advanced features. Including the secret easter egg!

This update fixes the "Null" News, and adds light mode!

With light mode, it contains it's own theme, and doesn't really change the buttons.

A modular system for the news window was implemented, and it'll hopefully be better for more windows. Maybe even
a window API!</p>
