# Writing a Song

Writing a song (essentially converting) is the act of converting a file to the "OGG" format. There are tools however; such as:

* http://ytmp3.cc/
* the utility "mp3 to ogg" python file in the NFy directory

You can combine these to download and listen to any song you'd like, or see if it's already been converted!

## Tutorial

To begin, get a youtube link, then add it to ytmp3.

Then copy the .mp3 to the NFy directory.

Then open cmd.

Type:

```bash

$ python3 mp32ogg.py "My Song Name.mp3"

```

Then you should have 'My Song Name.ogg" in the directory. If you don't already have one, make a `songs/` directory (if not already made) and 
place your song into that. After, you should have the song in your list! just play the song and you'll be good to go!
